# Angular Zurich Agent Rules

These instructions apply to work in this repository.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking.
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious.
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain.

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules.
- Do not set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It is the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management.
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes.
- Do not use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead.
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
- `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Accessibility Requirements

- It must pass all AXE checks.
- It must follow WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.

## Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators.
- Use `computed()` for derived state.
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in the `@Component` decorator.
- Prefer inline templates for small components.
- Prefer reactive forms instead of template-driven forms.
- Do not use `ngClass`; use `class` bindings instead.
- Do not use `ngStyle`; use `style` bindings instead.
- When using external templates or styles, use paths relative to the component TypeScript file.

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state.
- Use `computed()` for derived state.
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable.
- Do not use `mutate` on signals; use `update` or `set` instead.

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic.
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`.
- Use the async pipe to handle observables.
- Do not assume globals like `new Date()` are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates.

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility.
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services.
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection.
